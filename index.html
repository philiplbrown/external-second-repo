    <h1 class="box">Robert Cairns: The rematch people say they didn't want</h1>

        <h3 class="cat">I wonder if people saved their yard signs. The rematch seems pretty certain.</h3>
        <p class="egg">This week’s Republican Party caucuses in Iowa came out just like the polls said they would. Donald Trump won easily. Despite the increasingly feeble efforts of Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to prove they’re still relevant, they aren’t. Trump is going to be the GOP nominee.</p>
        <p class="egg">The beginning of this primary cycle is reminiscent of the last days of the 2016 race, when never-Trumpers tried to rally behind the last man who had not yet thrown in the towel — Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Cruz’s resistance was futile, even embarrassing, as he announced Carly Fiorina, a former corporate CEO who had earlier been dispatched by Trump, as his choice for vice president when it was clear he had no path to victory.</p>
        <p class="egg">A political cartoon at the time had Cruz saying, “Next week, after we lose (whatever state it was), we’ll pick a cabinet.” I wish I could remember which cartoonist it was. I’d credit him or her.</p>
